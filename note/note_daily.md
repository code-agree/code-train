Door supporting device for refrigerator
According to an aspect of the present invention for achieving the objects, there is provided a door supporting device for a refrigerator including a main body having a storage space with an open front face and a door for opening and closing the storage space. The door supporting device comprises a hinge bracket including a fixing portion fixed to a front face of the refrigerator, and a supporting portion extending forward from an upper end of the fixing portion and having a threaded hole with threads formed on an inner periphery thereof; a hinge shaft that has threads on an outer periphery thereof, is threadly engaged with the threaded hole so that the hinge shaft can be supported by the hinge bracket, and has an upper end for rotatably supporting the door; and a nut threadly engaged with the hinge shaft below the hinge bracket.
According to the present invention thus constructed, the nut is tightened to come into close contact with a bottom surface of the hinge bracket so that the rotation of the hinge shaft caused by impacts generated due to rotation or opening/closing of the door can be prevented. Thus, it will be apparent that the height of the door can be adjusted in upward and downward directions by means of the rotation of the hinge shaft.
In an embodiment of the present invention, the door supporting device further comprises a hinge cap fitted around the upper end of the hinge shaft and inserted into a hinge hole formed in a bottom surface of the door so as to rotatably support the door. Preferably, the hinge cap is formed of a synthetic resin material.

In an embodiment of the present invention, the hinge cap comprises a rearward extension and a rotation preventing projection extending downward from the extension, and the rotation preventing projection is inserted into a fixing hole of the hinge bracket so as to restrict rotation of the hinge cap. With the structure of the hinge cap, the hinge cap prevents the occurrence of noise due to friction upon opening/closing of the door and is not rotated with respect to the hinge bracket, thereby preventing unscrewing between the hinge shaft and the bracket due to the rotation of the door.

The heat exchanger tube 1 is produced by assembling together two half-divided tube plates.
The tube 1 includes an outer peripheral rib portion la which projects inward in the thickness direction thereof along the outer periphery thereof except for the entrance part 2 and exit part 3 thereof.

Also, the tube 1 includes a partition rib portion1b formed at the central position in the width direction of the tube 1 and extending toward the longitudinal direction of the tube from between the entrance part 2 and exist part 3 disposed on one end side of the tube 1. The rib portion 1b extends up to the vicinity of a U-turn flow path part 4C on the other end side of the tube 1. The rib portion 1b separates the tube 1 into two areas, that is, an upstream side linear flow path part 4A and a downstream side linear flow path part 4B.

The downstream side end of the upstream side linear flow path part 4A and the upstream side end of the downstream side linear flow path part 4b are allowed to communicate with each other on the other end side of the tube 1 by the U-turn flow path part 4C.
上游侧直线流路部4A的下游侧端部和下游侧直线流路部4b的上游侧端部通过U形转弯流路在管1的另一端侧连通 第 4C 部分。

Meanwhile, the entrance part 2 and exit part 3 are arranged side by side in the width direction of the tube 1. The entrance part 2 is connected to the upstream side end of the upstream side linear flow path part 4A continuously therewith, while the exit part 3 is connected to the downstream side end of the downstream side linear flow path part 4B continuously therewith.
另一方面，入口部2和出口部3在管1的宽度方向上并排设置。入口部2与上游侧直线流路部4A的上游侧端部连续连接，出口部2 部3与下游侧直线流路部4B的下游侧端部连续地连接。

Coated papers and cardboards and process for their manufacture

The compressible coating layer of the paper or cardboard of this invention can be an external layer. In this case, however, the surface of the coated paper or cardboard exhibits a high coefficient of friction which can hinder sliding of the coated sheets during transformation operations. Further, the absorption of inks and glaze is important because it can alter the freshness and gloss of the printing.

For these reasons, the coating layer containing the microspheres advantageously comprises an undercoat covered with an outside film that improves surface properties of the paper or cardboard, such as, sliding and gloss. This outside film is a conventional layer, for example, a coating layer with a sole base of mineral pigments, a film of an organic polymer that may be charged with pigments, or a film of an extruded organic polymer. Preferably, this outside layer is very thin so that it will not affect the improved flexibility provided by the microsphere- containing coating layer.
由于这些原因，含有微球体的涂层有利地包括覆盖有外膜的底涂层，该外膜改善了纸或纸板的表面性能，例如滑动性和光泽度。 该外膜是常规层，例如，具有矿物颜料的唯一基底的涂层、可填充颜料的有机聚合物膜、或挤出的有机聚合物膜。 优选地，该外层非常薄，以使其不会影响由含微球的涂层提供的改进的柔韧性。


The microspheres comprising the compressible layer are, for example, hollow microcapsules with flexible walls consisting of a polymer that can be softened by heating, such as polyvinylidene chloride,polystyrene, or a copolymer with an acrylonitrile and vinylidene chloride base, and containing gas which is inert with respect to the microshpere- forming material, such as isobutane, a a chlorinated or chlorofluorinated hydrocarbon derivative or carbon dioxide gas on the inside. The compressible coating layer containing the microspheres has a calculated average thickness of between 2 and 50 um or more.
构成可压缩层的微球例如是具有柔性壁的中空微胶囊，该中空微胶囊由可通过加热而软化的聚合物(例如聚偏二氯乙烯、聚苯乙烯或与丙烯腈和偏二氯乙烯基的共聚物)组成，并包含气体 对内部形成微球的材料，例如异丁烷、氯化或氯氟化烃衍生物或二氧化碳气体呈惰性。 包含微球体的可压缩涂层具有2至50微米或更大的计算平均厚度。
